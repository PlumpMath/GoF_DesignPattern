State Pattern

Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

-- As we can see that in our design each state is dependent on other state. This coupling can be removed by creating all the states in our Ecommenrce class and a
getter method for each state to get the State we want from there.  This was our state class will have no new Keyword.
