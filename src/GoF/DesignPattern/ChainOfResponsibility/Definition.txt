Chain of Responsibility Pattern

Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request.
Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.

--In COR if a request is handled then chain breaks, but it is not so in Decorator.
