Visitor Pattern

Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates. 

--In other word it tells you how to add functionality to all the elements(Duck) in Object structure(SimUApp) without opening/modifying the elements(Mallard, Redhead) itself. With this you can easily add the
new flying behaviuor but it will be applicabe to all the ducks unlike strategy where each duck can have a different fly behaviour.
